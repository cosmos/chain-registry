The network uses PETs (Privacy-Enhancing Technologies) to enable computation and storage on data while maintaining privacy, making possible use cases like private personalized AI, encrypted databases, data marketplace, and privacy-preserving applications.\n\n$NIL is the native utility token of the network that is used for:\n-Network fees for blind computation and payments across the Coordination Layer and Petnet\n-Staking to secure the network\n-Governance participation the onchain governance module\n\n$NIL enables access to Nillion modules and services such as:\n-DB: an encrypted database with data split up across multiple nodes. Calculations can still be performed on data while in encrypted form\n-AI: AI-focused privacy technologies that include:\n--AI Virtual Machine (AIVM) – a secure AI inference platform co-developed with Meta for private inference\n--Nada-AI – a library for nilVM, offering an interface for running small AI models\n--nilTEE – uses Trusted Execution Environments (TEEs) to run faster private inference where speed is important\n-nilVM: VM with libraries that simplify program development for AI devs by letting them use Python and Javascript to write web3 programs.",
