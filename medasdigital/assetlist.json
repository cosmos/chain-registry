      "extended_description": "MEDAS is the native utility token powering the MedasDigital decentralized scientific computing platform built on Cosmos SDK. The token enables a trustless marketplace connecting researchers who need computational resources with provider nodes that supply processing power. Researchers purchase and spend MEDAS tokens to submit computationally intensive scientific analysis jobs to the network, while nodes that execute jobs earn MEDAS tokens proportional to computational resources consumed and job complexity. Provider nodes stake MEDAS to participate in the network, ensuring accountability and quality of computational results. Token holders vote on scientific research priorities, protocol upgrades, and resource allocation. The platform supports astronomical computing including N-body orbital simulations, Trans-Neptunian Object clustering analysis, and systematic parameter space exploration for hypotheses like the Planet 9 search. Future expansion includes molecular dynamics for protein folding and drug discovery, climate science modeling, and distributed machine learning training. The economic model creates direct value exchange between computational supply and demand, with researchers getting access to distributed computing at competitive rates without relying on centralized cloud providers, while providers monetize unused computational capacity. All job submissions, results, and payments are recorded on-chain ensuring transparency and reproducibility. Initial deployment emphasizes astronomical research, specifically enabling large-scale grid searches over tens of thousands of orbital parameter combinations using real observational data from the Minor Planet Center and JPL Horizons.",
