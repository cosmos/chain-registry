      "extended_description": "Libra Coin is a fork from Facebook's Diem (Libra) blockchain that was announced in 2019. Libra Coin operates on its own high-performance Layer 1 blockchain, known as the 0L Network. In October 2021, Libra Coin began mining.\n\n Like Bitcoin, there were no pre-mined coins or dedicated token allocation to any parties; all coins were minted through a mining process. Unlike Bitcoin, which undergoes continuous issuance, Libra Coin has a fixed supply. By December 2023, all the Libra Coin had been issued, establishing a capped supply and making the coin permanently deflationary.\n\n Fiercely independent, the project has a long-term view because it is unburdened by venture capital funding, labs entities, a foundation, and the influence of other blockchain ecosystems.
