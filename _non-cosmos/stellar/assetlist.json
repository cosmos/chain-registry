      "extended_description": "The Stellar network is an open-sourced, public blockchain powered by the Stellar Consensus protocol (SCP), a proof-of-agreement (PoA) consensus mechanism. Thanks to PoA, the Stellar network is faster, cheaper, and far more energy-efficient than many other blockchains.\n\nIts core design makes it easy to create and issue digital assets that enable rapid payments at low-cost around the world. The Stellar network allows you to create your own currency or token within the network and distribute it digitally on a large scale. On the Stellar blockchain, you can create, send, and trade digital representations of almost any form of value such as â€“ US dollars, Argentine pesos, gold, and real estate. Then, the network acts as a bridge that connects financial systems and makes global interoperability a reality.",
