      "extended_description": "TTNT plays three essential roles in the Titan Network testnet ecosystem. As a medium of value, it enables customers to access network resources (computing, storage, and bandwidth) and allows resource providers to monetize their infrastructure, with all network transactions conducted in TTNT.\n\nThrough its staking mechanism based on Cosmos SDK, TTNT implements Delegated Proof of Stake for network security and consensus, rewarding participants who contribute to network stability.\n\nThe public chain architecture ensures transparency by recording all resource rentals and rewards, creating trust between resource providers and customers.",
